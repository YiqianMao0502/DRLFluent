This directory contains examples of various POA facilities.

All the examples implement the Echo server.

servantactivator.py and servantlocator.py do on-demand object
activation / location. If you run either program with a -l command
line argument, it will make a number of local calls to the object,
showing that the activator or locator runs in the local, as well as
the remote, case.

singlethread.py shows a single threaded POA. Only one thread at a time
is permitted to process requests, but invocations can happen on
different threads. mainthread.py performs all invocations on the main
thread, rather than threads created by omniORB.

Look at the source for each program to see extra things you can do
with them.

Before the programs will run, you must compile the IDL with

  omniidl -bpython echo.idl
