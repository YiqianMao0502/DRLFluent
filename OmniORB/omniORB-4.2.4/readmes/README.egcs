OmniORB has been tested with egcs-1.1.2 and gcc-2.95 on x86 linux.
The compiler must be configured with --enable-threads for the C++
exception handling to be thread safe.

With a few exceptions, egcs compilers on other platforms don't seem to
have proper support for thread-safe exception handling. Unless there
are information to the contrary, do not assume that you can use egcs
or gcc compiler on your platform to compile omniORB.

egcs/gcc-2.95 are known to work on:

- x86, powerpc linux (BUT not on alpha linux)
- sparc or x86 Solaris
- AIX
