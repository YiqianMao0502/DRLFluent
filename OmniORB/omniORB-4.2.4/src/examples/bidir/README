This example is almost identical to the call_back example, except that
it uses bidirectional GIOP for the callback. See the README file in
that directory for an explanation of what the programs do.

For it to work, make sure that you have the following configuration
parameters set:

  Server:
    acceptBiDirectionalGIOP = 1
    serverTransportRule = "* unix,tcp,bidir"

  Client:
    offerBiDirectionalGIOP = 1
    clientTransportRule = "* unix,tcp,bidir"
