This directory contains patches to the source to work around bugs in some
old / broken compilers.

This patch is for Dec C++ 5.6 on Tru64. It is against omniORB 3.0, so
it will not work with omniORB 4.0. It should give you a hint about
what needs to be done to omniORB 4.0, though. If you successfully
compile omniORB on this platform, please send an up to date patch to
the omniORB mailing list.

This patch is for the omnipython minimal Python 1.5 distribution,
required when compiling with the mingw GCC compiler on Windows.
