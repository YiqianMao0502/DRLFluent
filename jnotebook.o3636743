PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING:
Starting jupyter-notebook on node560 port 8888

You must now ssh in to the CSF3 from your local machine and tunnel
to the backend compute node. Use the following command on *your*
computer (not on the CSF3):

  ssh -L 8888:node560:8888 m83358ym@csf3.itservices.manchester.ac.uk

You should then start a web-browser on *your* computer and browse to:

  http://localhost:8888

If you are asked for a token to login to the notebook, have a look in
this job's .e file for the token by running the following command:

  jupyter-notebook-csf -t 3636743

(you should only run the above command *after* the batch job has started)

If you press the 'Quit' button in your notebook's web-page it will terminate the batch job.
If you press the 'Logout' button in your notebook's web-page or simply close the web-browser
then you *must* run the following command on the CSF3 to terminate the Jupyter batch job:

  qdel 3636743

Don't forget to log out of your tunnelled ssh session.
